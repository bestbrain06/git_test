Hello World!, odin.
I am learning to code with odin project.
The learning process has been great and have been understanding everything I am been taught.
Odin project has been a great learning platform for me to study, i have watched countless tutorial and even taken freecodecamp web development course but still did'nt have the confident that am a software engineer.
Odin project is helping me build my confidenet level and taking everything I need to know step by step.
